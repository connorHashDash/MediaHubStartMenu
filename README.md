# Media Hub Start Menu

After aquiring a mini PC from a friend I decided to use it to create an all round media hub for the
living room.

To get around the fact that a mouse had to be in the front room and I couldn't use a simple
bluetooth controller to start the software I created this *very* simple menu which does just that. 

Whiptail is used for the menu (I said it was simple). 

It uses antimicrox to use a bluetooth controller for the menu and then kills that process when
software boots so you don't have the bluetooth controller triggering arrow key presses in other
applications.
